Prior to CMU, I earned my B.S. in Data Science and Finance from <a href="https://shanghai.nyu.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">New York University Shanghai</a>, graduating <em>summa cum laude</em> with major honors in Data Science.</p> <p>I have industry experience as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at <a href="https://lifeattiktok.com/teams/technology" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TikTok</a>, an LLM Algorithm Intern at <a href="https://www.tcltech.com/en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TCL Technology</a>, and a Technical Engineer Intern at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaohongshu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RedNote (Xiaohongshu)</a>, where I worked on applied machine learning and large-scale AI systems.</p> <p>My current research interests focus on multimodal learning and diffusion-based generative models. I’m working on multimodal foundation models for healthcare at the <a href="https://autonlab.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Auton Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Artur Dubrawski</a>. In addition, I am interested in diffusion models and their applications to image editing and generative modeling.</p> <p>Beyond academics, I enjoy music composition and am self-studying fundamental music theory and production techniques. I also enjoy traveling and have visited Spain 🇪🇸, France 🇫🇷, England 🇬🇧, Croatia 🇭🇷, Australia 🇦🇺, Japan 🇯🇵, as well as many amazing places across the US 🗽!</p> <p>Feel free to reach out to me if you would like to connect 🙌🏻</p> </body></html>
