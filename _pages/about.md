I am a Master’s student in Machine Learning (MSML) in the Machine Learning Department within the School of Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). Prior to CMU, I earned my B.S. in Data Science and Finance from [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/), graduating _summa cum laude_ with major honors in Data Science.

I have industry experience as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at [TikTok](https://lifeattiktok.com/teams/technology), an LLM Algorithm Intern at [TCL Technology](https://www.tcltech.com/en), and a Technical Engineer Intern at [RedNote (Xiaohongshu)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaohongshu), where I worked on applied machine learning and large-scale AI systems.

My current research interests focus on multimodal learning and diffusion-based generative models. I'm working on multimodal foundation models for healthcare at the [Auton Lab](https://autonlab.org/), advised by [Prof. Artur Dubrawski](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/). In addition, I am interested in diffusion models and their applications to image editing and generative modeling.

Beyond academics, I enjoy music composition and am self-studying fundamental music theory and production techniques. I also enjoy traveling and have visited Spain 🇪🇸, France 🇫🇷, England 🇬🇧, Croatia 🇭🇷, Australia 🇦🇺, Japan 🇯🇵, as well as many amazing places across the US 🗽!
